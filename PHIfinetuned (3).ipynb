Diabetes is a lifestyle disease affecting individuals of all ages. To prevent diabetes-related complications, which are among the leading causes of death through heart attacks, brain strokes, kidney failure, and severe recurrent infections, we must control diabetes. Key to this is regular physical activity; at least 150 minutes of moderate to intense exercise per week is mandatory. This activity decreases insulin resistance, improves sugar metabolism, and reduces blood sugar levels. Another crucial aspect is a balanced diet with appropriate proportions of carbohydrates, proteins, fats, and vitamins, tailored to your physical activity. High sugar and high glycemic foods, as well as carbonated and high-fat foods, should be avoided. Including a variety of vegetables, beans, and nuts is also important.

Once diagnosed, we categorize the patient based on whether the cancer is localized within the prostate or has spread through the body. If the cancer is localized, two primary options are surgery to remove the prostate or external radiation therapy. Both options are extremely safe, often utilizing robotic technology for surgery, which involves joining the bladder with the urethra and leaving the patient with a catheter for seven days. The main advantage of surgery is complete removal of the prostate; however, it may result in temporary incontinence for six weeks to three months, alleviated through Kegel exercises. Disadvantages of radiation include mild incontinence in a small percentage of patients after three years. By choosing the appropriate treatment, patients can effectively manage prostate cancer.

              "   'Corrected Paragraph': 'I\\'m about to consult Balaji Consultancies from the Redneck On Call Z team at the post office with more than 12 years of experience in the field of oncology. Can foods have an immunological property to prevent the growth of cancer? This is a common question that almost all my patients ask once they have the diagnosis of cancer. \\'Can you take this for cancer? Can I take that to help prevent the growth of cancer?\\' No, this is relatively speaking. It was believed that some foods have the ability to prevent or slow down the growth of cancer. That said, so far, there is no proof that any particular food is useful in the prevention of cancer. In some areas where there is a deficiency, for example in the Linxian Province in China, there was a deficiency where they supplemented and brought it back to normal levels; that reduced the incidence of esophageal cancer. But if you look at it as a whole, no particular food has been proven to be effective. Too many uses of antioxidants all this is protective, but so far, nothing is proven. Some things which may be of benefit, as one, is an increase in incidence; decreased incidence of colon cancer with the use of vitamin D. But there are other things which can also cause an increase; like, for example, calcium causes a reduction in the development of colon cancer, but high doses of calcium can lead to the development of prostate cancer. So it is not a clear answer to this question. So, whenever my patients ask me this question, I tell them to go for a healthy diet. We all know what a healthy diet is: avoid meat to the maximum extent possible, do not smoke, do not drink. These are something which we can do, and generally take healthy home good food. So, don\\'t go for very high fat content or very oily foods, and you know, smoked foods can be had in moderation at times but not on a regular basis. If you take a healthy diet, that may be helpful in the management of cancer, but it may not really prevent cancer. Thank you.\"'},\n",

My area of specialization is surgery for deafness, including middle ear diseases, cochlear implants, and external auditory canal atresia. Another area of interest is endoscopic sinus surgery and surgery for rhinoplasty, that is, the shaping of the external nose. You see, sinusitis is an inflammation of the tissues lining the sinuses for more than a certain number of days, in medical terminology. In reality, what happens is, nine times out of ten, allergy is mistaken for sinusitis, and this is the problem we are facing in our medical practice today. The best way to diagnose is to subject the patient to a CT scan of their head, and when you see that, it's clear. The most important point that I would like to draw your attention to is that not all sinus issues are due to sinusitis; most of the time, it's due to allergies. Often it is due to facial pain; the cause is frequently allergies. Frequent allergies cause frequent infections, and frequent infections lead to chronic infection, and that is called sinusitis. Again, what happens is the inappropriate and excessive overuse, misuse, and abuse of antibiotics is what causes the sinus problem to become even more chronic. And once it reaches a certain level of chronicity, surgery will be required. Typically, the best way to treat sinus problems is to kill the allergies. As long as you diagnose your allergies, you're able to avoid whatever you are allergic to, whether food articles or environmental allergens, without the use of medication, antibiotics, and steroids. That is one of the best preventive ways to prevent getting sinusitis. It has to be treated appropriately by the doctor, by the consultant.

My area of specialization is surgery for deafness, including middle ear diseases, cochlear implants, and external auditory canal atresia. Another area of interest is endoscopic sinus surgery and surgery for rhinoplasty, that is, the shaping of the external nose. You know, tonsillitis is one of the most commonly misdiagnosed conditions. Most of the time, tonsillitis is not really an infection of the tonsils but is due to a bad throat caused by reflux acidity and caused by reduced immunity to the incidence of infection. And finally, it can also be due to frequent attacks of allergy. Allergy itself causes acidification of the throat, and this causes frequent pain akin to tonsillitis. Tonsillitis represents one of the most common reasons for the overuse and misuse of antibiotics. The best way to treat this kind of scenario is to have yourself diagnosed, whether there is really an infection. Simple tests such as CBC and ESR, that means erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein test, will give you an indication of whether we are dealing with an infection or just dealing with an irritated throat, which has an independent terminology 'reflux.' Now any of these can mimic tonsillitis, so the best thing for you to do is to diagnose which condition you have rather than continue antibiotics to take care of this condition. And sometimes, if it's due to allergy, a good allergy testing will help you.

              "   'Corrected Paragraph': \"Typically, the most menopausal women and elderly men are prone to osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is termed as a silent killer in orthopedics. I am a consultant spine surgeon at Apollo Hospital Systems. It develops very slowly and can lead to disastrous results if not taken care of. Typically, postmenopausal women and elderly men are prone to osteoporosis, and osteoporotic fractures can lead to significant disability if they happen in areas like the hip, shoulder, and wrist. Finding one of the most common sites of osteoporosis, though the factors can be more often than not quite subtle, they can lead to a significant amount of disability and deformity and very rarely can lead to something called as avascular necrosis, and that's what we want to prevent. So, how can we prevent osteoporosis? Until now, osteoporosis was always considered as a disease that is going to progress, and there's nothing we can do about it. But we have to remember that if you increase your quality of bone at quite an early age, like between 16 and 20 years of age group, your bones are much better. That means you have had good nutrition, you do good activities and exercise, and you make sure that you are holistically better. The bone density that is what we call peak bone mass. When it comes to postmenopausal period, we should always be taking good vitamin D3, calcium, proteins, and also keeping good activities, exercises, and also if required, if you want, we should take given treatment from your physician regarding osteoporosis to prevent or significantly delay osteoporosis. It can lead to disability, which we want to prevent. So make sure that you are doing regular activities, you are having good nutrition, and you are taking care of your osteoporosis. Women must take it seriously after menopause, and men after 60 years of age group. Thank you.\"},\n",

Some of these patients can be managed medically, but those patients who are above the BMI of 35 or in some cases about 32.5 may need surgery. Surgery is a very safe option for these patients, and it is the only option which has been proven to give very effective weight loss over a long period of time. They have been able to get back to their lives, they have been able to have children, they have been able to get back to active professions.

Today we're talking about kidney stones, the morbidity by which they form, what to take, what not to take, and how myths can mislead people. The moment someone is diagnosed with a stone, free advice is available everywhere, and every other person will probably advise you to avoid foods that are rich in calcium so you might not get stones. Two factors to understand here: one is calcium, and it is not that easy to avoid calcium without potentially putting yourself at risk as you get older, which in turn will increase the risk of osteoporotic fractures and so on. You would not want to avoid a normal amount of daily calcium, which has to be taken. In addition to this, avoiding calcium can actually increase the risk of stone formation. Naturally, the intestines, when they're deprived of calcium for some particular reason, start absorbing more oxalate. When more oxalates are absorbed, they get complexed and excreted in the kidney, and settle down as kidney stones. This is one common myth I wanted to bust. The second thing is you would probably hear a lot about tomatoes being common with stones. In fact, tomatoes, particularly, are not the culprit. It's one of those natural agents which are available, so you cannot stay away from tomatoes. Foods commonly mentioned are probably beverages, nuts, and chocolates as the consistent ones which can be blamed. These are things which you can avoid for all practical purposes. In the end, I would like to remind everybody that you don't have to avoid anything in total; instead, have these in small or moderate quantities and probably hydrate yourself well enough. Increasing the amount of citrate in your diet in terms of citrus fruits can prevent you from forming stones in the future. Myths in terms of calcium and tomatoes certainly need to be forgotten.

              "   'Corrected Paragraph': 'Myself Dr. Priyanka, a consultant urologist and nephrologist at Apollo Spectra Hospital, Kondapur, Hyderabad. What is prostate cancer? For that, we should know what the prostate is. The prostate is a walnut-shaped organ present below the bladder and surrounding the urethra. It is an organ present in male patients. This kind of cancer is very common in males after the age of 60 years. The symptoms related to prostate cancer are almost identical to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). What are the symptoms? Symptoms are related to storage and voiding. Storage symptoms include not being able to hold urine for a long time, increased frequency, urgency, and nighttime frequency. Voiding symptoms might include difficulty in urination, needing to strain, thin stream of urination, intermittency, and hesitancy. It has been seen that in prostate cancer, the symptoms related to voiding appear much earlier as compared to prostate enlargement. Therefore, screening of prostate cancer is very important. I will be giving you some briefing information on how to screen yourself for prostate cancer. As per the guidelines, if a patient has any family history of prostate cancer, he should screen himself after the age of 45 years. For the general public, screening should start after 50 years. The screening consists of three things: first, the patient should undergo a digital rectal examination (DRE) by consulting a urologist. Also, a normal scanning report related to his abdomen and pelvis should be done, which is not mandatory. Screening will help in recognizing prostate cancer earlier in an early stage, and proper treatment can be given. Prostate cancers are treated in the earliest stage in the form of surgery in which the whole prostate is removed. In the later stages, radiotherapy, hormone therapy, and chemotherapy are used. Thank you.'}]}"

            "[' Hello to everybody, I am Dr. Shankar Kumar, ENT consultant at Apollo Spectra Hospital, MRC Nagar. Once again, a very interesting question. Can sleep apnea be a life-threatening condition? The answer is an emphatic yes. Yes, it could be life threatening. So, sleep apnea patients, as you see, they are often very obese. Obesity is a major risk factor for sleep apnea and because of the obesity they have got other underlying medical comorbidities like hypertension, hypertension and so on and so forth so what happens in this condition sleep apnea they are deprived of adequate oxygen when they breathe and getting good oxygen to the body is very paramount, especially during sleep due to the oxygen deprivation that occurs in sleep apnea, again we are talking more about the obstructive type of sleep apnea. It may lead to various medical syndromes it may lead to hypertension it may lead to various problems in the heart many cardiac issues like myocardial ischemia, it may lead to myocardial infarction, irregularities in the heart rate and rhythm and may even lead to rare condition of a sudden cardiac death.', ' So again as I said earlier it is very imperative to treat patients with obstructive sleep apnea especially those who fall in the severe category they are very very prone to life threatening complications. Thank you again.']\n"

        "str=\" My name is Dr. Hariharumurthy. I've got about three decades of experience as an ENT surgeon, and I'm practicing now with the Apollo Spectra Hospitals, Koramangala. Ear infections commonly are seen in the external ear, outside the ear drum or in the middle ear inside the ear drum. This is the common nature of infections that we come across. Commonly seen in the external ear are infections caused by self cleaning habits for example people have the habit of using different types of instruments which can be pins, pens, keys, ear buds. In fact the buds are not even designed for cleaning the ear. So all these implements that are used to clean the ear is actually an exercise in futility because the ear is a self-cleaning mechanism. When one chews their food, the movement of the external part of the external ear is sufficient to bring out the excessive wax and bring it out without your intervention. Only when we try to perfect what nature has done, we tend to cause problems. And you can have injuries which can cause infections. Besides, you can push the wax inside and injure the structures of the external ear. There have been instances where the ear drum has been ruptured because of energetic self-cleaning because you're not seeing what you're cleaning so these are the things that can cause infections of the external ear swimming in dirty ponds is another cause for infection of the ear or swimmers ear which can be also identified as otomycosis. So these are practices which are not safe. Cleaning of the ear routinely with anything is completely proscribed. Coming to the middle ear infections, infections of the nose or the throat can track upwards into the ear and cause infections in the ear. So if a child is having any infection in the nose or the throat or having a severe cold or in a very small child between two to four years of age or five there can be tonsils and adenoids which can be the harboring areas of infection which easily get driven into the ear blowing your nose very hard is not a very good idea because that can also force bacteria into the middle ear from the nose. So treating the causes in the nose or the throat is a very critical aspect of preventing infections happening in the ear. Young children who have repetitive infections which can happen in the school going age in the early years is a common factor for infections in the year. So these children have to be treated for their primary problem and their immune responses have to be bolstered by proper practices to ensure that the infections don't happen in the year. you\"\n",

            ": My name is Dr. Harihar Meenapuram. I have about 30 years of experience as an ENT surgeon and I'm practicing now with the Apollo Spectra Hospitals, Koramangala. Snoring is a problem that has multiple causes and identifying the factors is critical. Obesity is one of them. Obstructions at the level of the nose or nasal pharynx are another. Children with adenoids can also have snoring. Just like adults having obstructions which can cause the problem, children can also have snoring. In the case of adults, usually the problem is because of obstructions like I said along with palatal elongation, flutter of the palate when breathing from the mouth as well as collapse of the pillars of the tonsils or the epic lotus itself can be a flutter causing snoring so identifying the cause is critical dealing with obesity is one of the important factors of snoring treatment. As long as that is done, we also have to address the local factors like doing surgery for the palate. In some cases, radiofrequency ablation of the palate can be done to reduce the flutter and the snoring. In other cases, surgery for the tonsils and the adenoids can be done to reduce the obstruction and the snoring. It is important to identify the cause of snoring and then tailor the treatment accordingly. Thank you. : 'Sometimes we do surgeries to the palate and pharyngeal tissues. As a result of this, we reduce the chances of snoring in patients with elongated and patulous palate. Sometimes we do put sutures in the palate and the pillars of the tonsil, which restrict the mobility and reduce snoring. These are factors that need to be addressed when dealing with snoring. So a holistic approach to the causes of snoring in a particular patient is necessary before choosing the appropriate treatment. This is important because snoring can be a symptom of a more serious condition like sleep apnea. Therefore, it is crucial to evaluate the patient's overall health before deciding on a treatment plan. The most common treatment for snoring is lifestyle changes, such as losing weight, avoiding alcohol and sedatives, and sleeping on your side. If these measures are not effective, then surgery may be considered. The type of surgery depends on the underlying cause of snoring. For example, if snoring is caused by a narrowed airway, then a procedure to widen the airway may be recommended. If snoring is caused by a structural abnormality in the nose or throat, then a procedure to correct that abnormality may be recommended\n"

Obstructive sleep apnea can occur due to obstructions at any of the following sites: the nasal passages, the throat (pharynx), the region of the palate, and sometimes due to a bulky base of the tongue. These conditions may cause obstructive sleep apnea. Of course, more rarely, there may be a mix of central sleep apnea and obstructive sleep apnea, and a mix of the two conditions is called mixed sleep apnea.

            "'The question that I've been asked is what are the types of sleep apnea? I am Dr. Shankar Kumar, an ENT consultant at Apollo Spectra Hospital, MRC Nagar. So sleep apnea, as I described in the earlier questions, is due to episodes of breath-holding spells that occur during sleep. Sleep apnea is mainly of two types. See, it's often we must understand that during breathing, the breathing occurs on its own mode. It's an automatic response. The centers in the brain send the appropriate signals to the muscles of breathing to ensure that they are activated.

They are called so because of the cosmetic problems they may cause sometimes you will see swelling over here if they grow very big then they may compress the air so they can cause difficult in breathing and sometimes they can over produce the hormones so these are the common problems with the benign thyroid so what are the treatment options for benign thyroid nodules the treatment options are surgical and non-surgical surgery has been done for quite some time but the biggest disadvantage of surgery is that it leaves his scar over the neck one thing second the pain is the total recovery time is and if it damages the nerves then it can give some impact on the voice the latest advancement in the thyroid nodules are the ablation in ablation we have multiple types of application like radio frequency evolution and microwave ovulation these are Minimal invasive methods by which these benign thyroid nodules can be treated so if the patient is not willing for surgery if the patient has cosmetic problem because of thyroid or if the thyroid nodule is causing some compression over the airway, then the treatment options are surgery or ablation.

        "# Sometimes we will see swelling over here. If they grow very big then they may compress the airway. So they can cause difficulty in breathing and sometimes they can overproduce the hormones. So these are the common problems with the benign thyroid nodules. So what are the treatment options for benign thyroid nodules? The treatment options are surgical and non-surgical. Surgery has been done for quite some time. But the biggest disadvantage of surgery is that it leaves a scar over the neck. One thing. Second, the pain is more. The total recovery time is far more. And if it damages the nerves, then it can give some impact on the voice. So the latest advancement in the thyroid nodules are the ablation. In ablation we have multiple types of ablation like radio frequency ablation and microwave ablation. These are minimally invasive methods by which these benign thyroid nodules can be treated. So if the patient is not willing for surgery, if the patient has cosmetic problem because of thyroid or if the thyroid nodule is causing some compression over the airway. They are the candidates who should undergo these therapies. How do we do it? So this treatment is done under local anesthesia. The patient is admitted for a day care admission and it's usually a walk in walk out procedure where the patient walks in the hospital and walks out on his own so it is done in local anesthesia so first of all we give an anesthetic injection around the nodule. Then we insert a microwave or radio frequency antenna, which is less than two millimeter in size and send that antenna inside that nodule and then we burn it from inside. So the recovery time is very fast and it usually does not leave any scar and the chances of injury to different organs are very less. And when we burn this nodule, gradually the nodule shrinks in size and the cosmetic problems totally goes away. So if you have any overgrowth in the neck region which is involving thyroid you can always consult your interventional radiologist so that it can be confirmed by doing fine needle aspiration that whether these are benign or malignant. If they are benign, then you can always receive such treatments."

Snoring is a problem that has got multiple reasons and identifying the factors is critical. Obesity is one of them. Obstructions at the level of the nose or nasal pharynx are another. Children with adenoids can also have snoring. Just like adults having obstructions which can cause the problem, children can also have snoring. In the case of adults, usually the problem is because of obstructions like I said along with palatal elongation, flutter of the palate when breathing from the mouth as well as collapse of the pillars of the tonsils or the epic lotus itself can be a flutter causing snoring so identifying the cause is critical dealing with obesity is one of the important factors of snoring treatment. As long as that is done, we also have to address the local factors like doing surgery for the palate. Sometimes we do restructuring of the palate and the pharyngeal tissues. As a result of that we reduce the flutter chances of the elongated and patulous palate. Sometimes we do put sutures in the palate and the pillars of the tonsil which restrict the mobility as a result reduce the snoring.
