            "[\"144 Accountancy : Company Accounts and Analysis of Financial Statements\\nHaving understood how a company raises its\\ncapital, we have to learn the nature, objectives\\nand types of financial statements it has to prepare\\nincluding their contents, format, uses andlimitations. The financial statements are the end\\nproducts of accounting process. They are prepared\\nfollowing accounting policies consistentlyaccounting standards prescribed in the CompaniesAct and accounting concepts, principles,\\nprocedures and also the legal environment in which\\nthe business organisations operate. Thesestatements are the outcome of the summarising\\nprocess of accounting and are, therefore, the\\nsources of information on the basis of whichconclusions are drawn about the profitability andthe financial position of a company. Hence, they\\nneed to be arranged in a proper form with suitable\\ncontents so that the shareholders and other usersof financial statements can easily understand anduse them in their economic decisions in a\\nmeaningful way.\\n3.1 Meaning of Financial Statements\\nFinancial statements are the basic and formal\\nannual reports through which the corporate\\nmanagement communicates financial informationto its owners and various other external partieswhich include investors, tax authorities,\\ngovernment, employees, etc. These refer to: the\\nbalance sheet (position statement) as at the end ofaccounting period, the statement of profit and lossof a company and the cash flow statementFinancial Statements of a Company 3\\nLEARNING  OBJECTIVES\\nAfter studying this chapter ,\\nyou will be able to :\\n•explain the nature andobjectives of financialstatements of acompany;\\n•describe the form andcontent of Statement ofProfit and Loss of acompany as perschedule III;\\n•describe the form andcontent of balance sheetof a company as perschedule III;\\n•explain the significanceand limitations offinancial statements;and\\n•prepare the financialstatements.\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n145 Financial Statements of a Company\\n3.2 Nature of Financial Statements\\nThe chronologically recorded facts about events expressed in monetary terms\\nfor a defined period of time are the basis for the preparation of periodical financial\\nstatements which reveal the financial position as on a date and the financial\\nresults obtained during a period. The American Institute of Certified Public\\nAccountants states the nature of financial statements as, “the statements\\nprepared for the purpose of presenting a periodical review of report on progress\\nby the management and deal with the status of investment in the business and\\nthe results achieved during the period under review. They reflect a combination\\nof recorded facts, accounting principles and personal judgements”.\\nThe following points explain the nature of financial statements:\\n1.Recorded Facts:  Financial statements are prepared on the basis of\\nfacts in the form of cost data recorded in accounting books. The originalcost or historical cost is the basis of recording transactions. The figures\\nof various accounts such as cash in hand, cash at bank, trade\\nreceivables, fixed assets, etc., are taken as per the figures recorded in\\nthe accounting books. The assets purchased at different times and at\\ndifferent prices are put together and shown at costs. As these are not\\nbased on market prices, the financial statements do not show currentfinancial condition of the concern.\\n2.Accounting Conventions:  Certain accounting conventions are followed\\nwhile preparing financial statements. The convention of valuing\\ninventory at cost or market price, whichever is lower, is followed. The\\nvaluing of assets at cost less depreciation principle for balance sheet\\npurposes is followed. The convention of materiality is followed in dealingwith small items like pencils, pens, postage stamps, etc. These items\\nare treated as expenditure in the year in which they are purchased\\neven though they are assets in nature. The stationery is valued at cost\\nand not on the principle of cost or market price, whichever is less. The\\nuse of accounting conventions makes financial statements comparable,\\nsimple and realistic.\\n3.Postulates: Financial statements are prepared on certain basic\\nassumptions (pre-requisites) known as postulates such as going\\nconcern postulate, money measurement postulate, realisation\\npostulate, etc. Going concern postulate assumes that the enterprise is\\ntreated as a going concern and exists for a longer period of time. So the\\nassets are shown on historical cost basis. Money measurement\\npostulate assumes that the value of money will remain the same in\\ndifferent periods. Though there is drastic change in purchasing power\\nof money, the assets purchased at different times will be shown at\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n146 Accountancy : Company Accounts and Analysis of Financial Statements\\nthe amount paid for them. While, preparing statement of profit and\\nloss the revenue is included in the sales of the year in which the sale\\nwas undertaken even though the sale price may be received over a\\nnumber of years. The assumption is known as realisation postulate.\\n4.Personal Judgements:  Under more than one circumstance, facts and\\nfigures presented through financial statements are based on personal\\nopinion, estimates and judgements. The depreciation is provided taking\\ninto consideration the useful economic life of fixed assets. Provisions\\nfor doubtful debts are made on estimates and personal judgements.\\nIn valuing inventory, cost or market value, whichever is less is being\\nfollowed. While deciding either cost of inventory or market value of\\ninventory, many personal judgements are to be made based on certain\\nconsiderations. Personal opinion, judgements and estimates are made\\nwhile preparing the financial statements to avoid any possibility of\\nover statement of assets and liabilities, income and expenditure,\\nkeeping in mind the convention of conservatism.\\nThus, financial statements are the summarised reports of recorded facts\\nand are prepared the following accounting concepts, conventions, accounting\\npolicies, accounting standards and requirements of Law.\\n3.3 Objectives of Financial Statements\\nFinancial statements are the basic sources of information to the shareholders\\nand other external parties for understanding the profitability and financial\\nposition of any business concern. They provide information about the results of\\nthe business concern during a specified period of time in terms of assets and\\nliabilities, which provide the basis for taking decisions. Thus, the primary\\nobjective of financial statements is to assist the users in their decision-making.\\nThe specific objectives include the following:\\n1.To provide information about economic resources and obligations ofa business:  They are prepared to provide adequate, reliable and\\nperiodical information about economic resources and obligations of abusiness firm to investors and other external parties who have limited\\nauthority, ability or resources to obtain information.\\n2.To provide information about the earning capacity of the business:They are to provide useful financial information which can gainfully\\nbe utilised to predict, compare and evaluate the business firm’s earning\\ncapacity.\\n3.To provide information about cash flows:  They are to provide\\ninformation useful to investors and creditors for predicting, comparing\\nand evaluating, potential cash flows in terms of amount, timing and\\nrelated uncertainties.\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n147 Financial Statements of a Company\\n4.To judge effectiveness of management: They supply information useful\\nfor judging management’s ability to utilise the resources of a business\\neffectively.\\n5.Information about activities of business affecting the society:  They\\nhave to report the activities of the business organisation affecting thesociety, which can be determined and described or measured and which\\nare important in its social environment.\\n6.Disclosing accounting policies:  These reports have to  provide the\\nsignificant policies, concepts followed in the process of accounting and\\nchanges taken up in them during the year to understand thesestatements in a better way.\\n3.4 Types of Financial Statements\\nThe financial statements generally include two statements: balance sheet and\\nstatement of profit and loss which are required for external reporting and also\\nfor internal needs of the management like planning, decision-making andcontrol. Apart from these, there is also a need to know about movements of\\nfunds and changes in the financial position of the company. For this purpose,\\na cash flow statement is prepard.\\nEvery company registered under The Companies Act 2013 shall prepare\\nits balance sheet, statement of profit and loss and notes to account thereto in\\naccordance with the manner prescribed in the revised Schedule III to the\\nCompanies Act, 2013 to harmonise the disclosure requirement with theaccounting standards and to converge with new reforms.\\nBalance Sheet as at 31st March, 20.....\\nParticulars Note No. Figure as Figure as\\nat the end at the end\\nof Current of Previous\\nreporting reporting\\nperiod period\\nI.

Board of\\nDirectors propose the dividend after the annual accounts for the year have\\nbeen prepared. Annual General Meeting of the shareholders is held thereafter\\nmeaning it is held in the next financial year.\\nShareholders may reduce the amount of proposed dividend but cannot increase\\nit.

Financial\\nstatements provide the necessary information about the performance of the\\nmanagement to these parties interested in the organisation and help in taking\\nappropriate economic decisions. It may be noted that the financial statements\\nconstitute an integral part of the annual report of the company in addition to\\nthe directors report, auditors report, corporate governance report, and\\nmanagement discussion and analysis.\\nThe various uses and importance of financial statements are as follows:\\n1.Report on stewardship function:  Financial statements report the\\nperformance of the management to the shareholders. The gaps betweenthe management performance and ownership expectations can be\\nunderstood with the help of financial statements.\\n2.Basis for fiscal policies: The fiscal policies, particularly taxation policies\\nof the government, are related with the financial performance of\\ncorporate undertakings. The financial statements provide basic input\\nfor industrial, taxation and other economic policies of the government.\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n165 Financial Statements of a Company\\n3.Basis for granting of credit:  Corporate undertakings have to borrow\\nfunds from banks and other financial institutions for different purposes.\\nCredit granting institutions take decisions based on the financial\\nperformance of the undertakings. Thus, financial statements form\\nthe basis for granting of credit.\\n4.Basis for prospective investors: The investors include both short-termand long-term investors. Their prime considerations in their investment\\ndecisions are security and liquidity of their investment with reasonable\\nprofitability. Financial statements help the investors to assess long-\\nterm and short-term solvency as well as the profitability of the\\nconcern.\\n5.Guide to the value of the investment already made: Shareholders of\\ncompanies are interested in knowing the status, safety and return on\\ntheir investment. They may also need information to take decision\\nabout continuation or discontinuation of their investment in the\\nbusiness. Financial statements provide information to the shareholders\\nin taking such important decisions.\\n6.Aids trade associations in helping their members:  Trade associations\\nmay analyse the financial statements for the purpose of providing\\nservice and protection to their members. They may develop standard\\nratios and design uniform system of accounts.\\n7.Helps stock exchanges: Financial statements help the stock exchanges\\nto understand the extent of transparency in reporting on financialperformance and enables them to call for required information to protect\\nthe interest of investors. The financial statements enable the Stock\\nbrokers to judge the financial position of different concerns and take\\ndecisions about the prices to be quoted.\\n3.6 Limitations of Financial Statements\\nThough utmost care is taken in the preparation of the financial statements\\nand provide detailed information to the users, they suffer from the following\\nlimitations:\\n1.Do not reflect current situation:  Financial statements are prepared\\non the basis of historical cost. Since the purchasing power of money\\nis changing, the values of assets and liabilities shown in financial\\nstatement do not reflect current market situation.\\n2.Assets may not realise: Accounting is done on the basis of certain\\nconventions. Some of the assets may not realise the stated values, if\\nthe liquidation is forced on the company. Assets shown in the balance\\nsheet reflect merely unexpired or unamortised cost.\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n166 Accountancy : Company Accounts and Analysis of Financial Statements\\n3.Bias: Financial statements are the outcome of recorded facts,\\naccounting concepts and conventions used and personal judgements\\nmade in different situations by the accountants. Hence, bias may be\\nobserved in the results, and the financial position depicted in financial\\nstatements may not be realistic.\\n4.Aggregate information: Financial statements show aggregate\\ninformation but not detailed information. Hence, they may not help\\nthe users in decision-making much.\\n5.Vital information missing:  Balance sheet does not disclose information\\nrelating to loss of markets, and cessation of agreements, which have\\nvital bearing on the enterprise.\\n6.No qualitative information:  Financial statements contain only\\nmonetary information but not qualitative information like industrial\\nrelations, industrial climate, labour relations, quality of work, etc.\\n7.They are only interim reports:  Statement of Profit and Loss discloses\\nthe profit/loss for a specified period. It does not give an idea about the\\nearning capacity over time similarly, the financial position reflected in\\nthe balance sheet is true at that point of time, the likely change on a\\nfuture date is not depicted.\\nTerms Introduced in the Chapter\\n1.

In most cases, about 90% of the time, the flu (influenza) can cause some viral infections. These infections are usually self-limiting and improve without any specific treatment or with just symptomatic treatment. However, some patients may need antiviral medications.\n\nPatients with the flu can get secondary bacterial infections, especially staphylococcal infections or pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. This is because the flu affects the airways and makes them more susceptible to bacterial infections. In severe cases, the patient may require mechanical ventilation.\n\nViral infections caused by the flu can also cause pneumonia, which may present as bilateral pneumonia. This can be life-threatening and affect oxygenation. While some patients may only require 1-2 liters of oxygen, others may progress rapidly and develop more complications by the 7th or 8th day. This may require invasive mechanical ventilation, and the complications can escalate up to 110%.\n\nSometimes, the secondary infections caused by the flu can lead to multi-organ failure, and in rare cases, even death (though the chances are less than 4%). That's why we strongly recommend flu vaccinations to prevent these severe outcomes and reduce the risk of death.\n\nInfluenza is a well-known disease, and there is a yearly flu vaccination available as a preventive measure. Pneumonia is definitely common with the flu, but its incidence has come down because we have specific treatments for influenza and have vaccinations that can provide protection for a year."

            "Hello, this is Dr. Kamal Devgn, MSc, ENT. Currently, I am working at Apollo Hospital as a consultant in the department of ENT and Head and Neck Surgery. Today we will discuss OSA. OSA is Obstructive Sleep Apnea. It is a type of sleep apnea in which there is partial or complete obstruction of breathing during the night. There are repetitive episodes of obstruction of breathing which can last for 20 to 40 seconds. It can occur multiple times during the night. It leads to a decrease in blood saturation, which further leads to repetitive episodes, leading to decreased oxygen supply to the brain triggering a response in the brain that is called neurological awakening. This neurological awakening leads to frequent awakenings during the night, which further leads to restlessness. The patient wakes up with morning headaches, tiredness, forgetfulness, changes in mood, and behavior. This obstruction can be complete or partial. Temporary obstruction or sleep apnea can occur because of intoxicating drugs like alcohol and some medications. Complete obstruction can be because of soft tissue pathology, excessive muscle relaxation due to brain injury, or a deviated nasal septum, with increased hypertrophy of the turbinates acting as an obstruction to the nasal airway. Thank you.\n"

I've got about three decades of experience as an ENT surgeon and I'm practicing now with the Apollo Spectra Hospitals, Koramangala. Snoring is a problem that has got multiple reasons and identifying the factors is critical. Obesity is one of them. Obstructions at the level of the nose or nasal pharynx are another. Children with adenoids can also have snoring. Just like adults having obstructions which can cause the problem, children can also have snoring. In the case of adults, usually the problem is because of obstructions like I said along with palatal elongation, flutter of the palate when breathing from the mouth as well as collapse of the pillars of the tonsils or the epic lotus itself can be a flutter causing snoring so identifying the cause is critical dealing with obesity is one of the important factors of snoring treatment. As long as that is done, we also have to address the local factors like doing surgery for the palate. Sometimes we do restructuring of the palate and the pharyngeal tissues. As a result of that we reduce the flutter chances of the elongated and patulous palate. Sometimes we do put sutures in the palate and the pillars of the tonsil which restrict the mobility as a result reduce the snoring. Such are the factors which have to be addressed when dealing with snoring. So a holistic look at the causes for that particular patient would be necessary before we choose the particular treatment which is required for him.

Tonsils are two lymphoid structures which are situated at the back of the throat on either side of the base of the tongue. These are part of what is known as a protective ring to prevent the child from getting further infection. The other two aspects are the adenoids at the back of the nose and the lingual tonsil at the back of the tongue. These act as protective sentinels at the throat for a child who is growing up and they are the primary functional immune busters in the body for the child. At the age of 2, the tonsils start becoming active along with the adenoids in building the immune responses. Now a child that's growing up starts putting things in the mouth as a practice of identifying whether it is edible or not first source of infection the child breathes in air which may be infected and the child is going out from the confines of the house to an outer area when it starts walking after 2. So the child is exposed to infection. Nature has put this, nature has put this tonsil and adenoid there for the purpose of preventing the infections going further down so a child who has tonsillitis doesn't require anything more than effective treatment of the tonsillitis. Invariably it settles down. Almost all children will have an attachment problem. invariably it settles down. Almost all children will have an attack or two of tonsillitis and when they are growing up it's part of the process of building immunity. Not everybody requires anything further than that. Treat them and if they are fine. Some of them start having serious problems which require to be addressed. For example, there is an enlargement of the size of the tonsils as a result of which they have breathing difficulty, snoring, swallowing problems. Those are times when surgery is warranted in the child. For that matter, even an adult who has got tonsillitis, which is very large large can be a cause for snoring and breathing difficulty. It could be repetitively getting infected which may be a serious cause for problem. Recurring bronchitis, asthma, because of infections going down into the air passages is one of the features of untreated tonsillitis. So when the tonsillitis is chronic and causing problems, those are the situations which have to be addressed and if required tonsillectomy may have to be a modality of treatment. Not every tonsil needs to be removed. We have to choose the surgery for the particular patient alone.\", \" My name is Dr. Harihar Murthy.

Snoring at best can be called a problem of social importance because it disturbs the bed partner or the people in the house because of the noise. But what it hides is a more sinister issue which can be serious for the person concerned. Storing is only the window dressing. What it hides is actually the possibility of a sleep apnea which can be very serious in its way it affects the person. Sleep apnea by virtue of repetitive stoppage of breathing can cause reduction in oxygen levels that are going into the patient. So obviously the oxygen levels dropping has got a serious potent for the brain and the individual generally. People who have severe sleep apnoea will be poor productive people in daily life. It affects their hypertension if they have or they become susceptible to hypertension or even type 2 diabetes in such people. Apart from that it also affects their sexual health. So snoring is not just an issue of ordinary importance, it has to be dealt with seriously by identifying the primary causes and the attendant problems that may be associated like sleep apnea. back now.\", \" My name is Dr. Hariharumurthy.

Sinusitis is the infection of the air-filled cavities in the bones of the face which surround the nasal cavity. So literally the sinuses hug the inner surface of the eye socket on either side They are paired because they equal on both sides and at the back of the nose you have a couple they are all together the airfield cavities which are literally the crumple zones of the face if there is an injury to the head let presume, the force is actually taken up by the crumple zones in the face. That is one of the purposes of the sinuses being there. The other is that the sinuses being there the other is that the sinuses because of the air in the face all in the bones of the face also prevent the head from becoming very heavy. So there is no head weight. The third is the resonance to the voice that we have that happens because of the resonance of the sound through these air filled cavities. The other thing that happens is the air within the sinuses comprises of air which is of a slightly antiseptic quality which is not the same as the air that we breathe in. So these are the multiple factors of purposes of the sinus being there as we know it. Now if there is any change in the air flow in the nose, the aerodynamics changing can change the quality of the air in the sinuses, it can change the amount of air in the sinuses, or can also supply bacteria into the sinuses which cause infections. So the case has to be dealt with as what is causing the infection. into the sinuses which cause infections. So the case has to be dealt with as what is causing the infection and thus sinusitis can be treated effectively. Identifying the primary causative factors for sinusitis is important otherwise we are just going to keep cutting grass without having to strike it out with the root.

Ear infections commonly are seen in the external ear, outside the ear drum or in the middle ear inside the ear drum. This is the common nature of infections that we come across. Commonly seen in the external ear are infections caused by self cleaning habits for example people have the habit of using different types of instruments which can be pins, pens, keys, ear buds. In fact the buds are not even designed for cleaning the ear. So all these implements that are used to clean the ear is actually an exercise in futility because the ear is a self-cleaning mechanism. When one chews their food, the movement of the external part of the external ear is sufficient to bring out the excessive wax and bring it out without your intervention. Only when we try to perfect what nature has done, we tend to cause problems. And you can have injuries which can cause infections. Besides, you can push the wax inside and injure the structures of the external ear. There have been instances where the ear drum has been ruptured because of energetic self-cleaning because you're not seeing what you're cleaning so these are the things that can cause infections of the external ear swimming in dirty ponds is another cause for infection of the ear or swimmers ear which can be also identified as otomycosis. So these are practices which are not safe. Cleaning of the ear routinely with anything is completely proscribed. Coming to the middle ear infections, infections of the nose or the throat can track upwards into the ear and cause infections in the ear. So if a child is having any infection in the nose or the throat or having a severe cold or in a very small child between two to four years of age or five there can be tonsils and adenoids which can be the harboring areas of infection which easily get driven into the ear blowing your nose very hard is not a very good idea because that can also force bacteria into the middle ear from the nose. So treating the causes in the nose or the throat is a very critical aspect of preventing infections happening in the ear. Young children who have repetitive infections which can happen in the school going age in the early years is a common factor for infections in the year. So these children have to be treated for their primary problem and their immune responses have to be bolstered by proper practices to ensure that the infections don't happen in the year. you\", \" My name is Dr. Harihar Murthy.

Sleep apnea is a problem which a person can have when there is some obstruction to normal breathing especially during sleep. The obstruction is usually at the level of the nose, nasopharynx or the palate. It can be of two types. Sleep apnea can be caused by sometimes central but most commonly by obstructions which are static at the level of the nose or the nasopharynx the dynamic obstructions are the palatal obstructions which happen only during sleep or the pharyngeal collapse which can also cause obstruction during sleep. So sleep apnea per se means a person has stopped breathing during their sleep. So what happens here is the person has repetitive obstruction or stoppage of breathing that is happening in the sleep cycle. Up to three events in a sleep cycle of six to eight hours is acceptable as normal. But if it is in excess of that, it certainly is abnormal. And usually people with sleep apnea have obstructions or stoppage of breathing which can be up to multiple times in every hour. So this has to be addressed. Why? Because obstruction to sleep and obstruction to breathing can be a major cause of long standing illnesses such as Hypertension, Coronary artery disease, diabetes etc. So it is not common to think of a no solution for a person with sleep apnea. Contrary to that it has to be addressed properly aggressively so that we make sure the person is breathing continuously during sleep the sleep breathing should be unconscious and effortless like in the waking state in the event that it is not effortless and unconscious there is a problem if a person has got sleep apnea trust me it has to be addressed by the concerned person's physician aggressively and made sure that it has been dealt with. Otherwise we stand the risk of even having serious problems. In fact there have been cases reported of sudden death in sleep because of severe sleep apnea. So it is not to be trifled with. It has to be dealt with accordingly. Thank you.\", \" My name is Dr. Harihar Murthy.

What happens here is the body is not able to accept some foreign object which is entering into the nasal cavity and the person is triggered to sneeze have running nose watery discharge etc what is the person allergic to is a question that deserves to be addressed. So people are allergic to different aspects which may be environmental in origin for example pollen of different kinds it could be due to fungi which is common in moist areas, it could also be dust mites which is a very common cause for nasal allergy, dander, animal dander, pet dander or pigeon feathers or pigeon droppings or cattle dander, these are common causes for allergy. Cockroach droppings, another cause for allergy. So we have to identify the allergy. If we do not identify the allergy, whatever treatment is done is only symptomatic and it will work as long as the medicine is being consumed. So once we have stopped the medication, it will recur. If we are looking at a long term therapy plan for allergy, identifying the allergen is the first thing to do. And then we can start a long term immunotherapy plan which runs into a few years. The idea is that we immunize that person against the particular allergen as a result of which we can build the own innate immunity for the person to deal with the challenge whenever they face it. So allergy can be treated if the person and the physician have the patience to go through this long drawn process Thank you.\", \" My name is Dr. Harihar Murthy.

Cochlear implants are bionic devices which are implanted into the inner ear to stimulate the nerve directly. Now the cochlea is the interface between the mechanical sound which is heard and the electrical impulses that are generated in the cochlea. Now when there is a problem of this interface at the level of the hair cells of the cochlea. One can be implanted with a cochlear implant device. This device has to be chosen very carefully for the person such that they are able to get the maximum benefit of it which means the earlier the child is identified for hearing deficit and suitable for a cochlear implant the better. Having said that, even children who are a little older than a couple of years have also benefited immensely by the cochlear implant device. The brain has the ability to actually start shrinking areas which are not required and the neighboring areas take over. For example, the hearing in the brain is at the auditory cortex, which is situated in the lateral aspect of the brain. Right behind that is the visual cortex, which is situated at the back of the brain. Now when the auditory cortex is not adequately stimulated by the nerves from the ear, Then there is a cannibalizing of that area by the adjacent visual cortex which takes over the redundant area. Very much like how people annex different areas around their houses to increase their land area. This is what happens at the level of the brain, spontaneously, automatically as a result of which the auditory cortex shrinks. So identifying this problem very early plays a major role in the amount of benefit a person can get out of the surgical procedure. Adults who have had hearing and lost it as they have grown older because of the damage to the hair cells can also benefit from cochlear implants. So adults who have lost their normal hearing can benefit immensely because they don't need to be trained for new voice. They already have the voice. Unlike a child who requires habilitation and training over a long period of time for getting the best benefit of a cochlear implant Thank you.\", ' Hello to everybody, I am Dr. Shankar Kumar, ENT consultant at Apollo Spectra Hospital, MRC Nagar. Once again, a very interesting question. Can sleep apnea be a life-threatening condition? The answer is an emphatic yes. Yes, it could be life threatening. So, sleep apnea patients, as you see, they are often very obese. Obesity is a major risk factor for sleep apnea and because of the obesity they have got other underlying medical comorbidities like hypertension, hypertension and so on and so forth so what happens in this condition sleep apnea they are deprived of adequate oxygen when they breathe and getting good oxygen to the body is very paramount, especially during sleep due to the oxygen deprivation that occurs in sleep apnea, again we are talking more about the obstructive type of sleep apnea. It may lead to various medical syndromes it may lead to hypertension it may lead to various problems in the heart many cardiac issues like myocardial ischemia, it may lead to myocardial infarction, irregularities in the heart rate and rhythm and may even lead to rare condition of a sudden cardiac death. So again as I said earlier it is very imperative to treat patients with obstructive sleep apnea especially those who fall in the severe category they are very very prone to life threatening complications. Thank you again.', \" Hello to everybody. I am Dr. Shankar Kumar. I am an EIT Consultant Surgeon at Apollo Spectra Hospital, MR Senagar. It's a very interesting question which has been asked to me. How does one know that he is getting infected with the sinus condition? Well, by way of the symptoms, it's very easy to predict that one is going to get a sinus infection. The symptoms are very typical. Of course a patient may not have all the symptoms but he will have at least 2 to 3 of the symptoms that I am going to mention here. Patient generally have sort of nasal congestion. They may have a thick nasal discharge which may be occasionally be discolored depending on the extent of the infection. They also have constant mucus trickling into the throat and this is a condition which we commonly call as a post nasal drip. Additionally, they may also have symptoms of facial pain, facial pressure and also headache and as I mentioned earlier due to the post nasal discharge they may have symptoms of a sore throat and they may have a cough as well and if the infection is very extreme they may also have what is called as a bad breath. So this is the symptom as far from the patient side of view. But the diagnosis can be easily made by the consultant ENT surgeon by way of a good examination of the nose and this may be aided and supplemented by doing what is called as a nasal endoscopy. Thank you.\", ' Hello to everybody. I am Dr. Shankar Kumar, ENT consultant at Apollo Spectra Hospital, MRC Nagar. So this is yet one more very interesting question which has been asked. What are the symptoms of sleep apnea in adults? So I would like to say what is meant by sleep apnea. Apnea is literally the meaning of apnea as breath holding spells wherein during deep sleep the patient who suffers from sleep apnea may develop multiple breath holding spells and generally we label the patient as having sleep apnea if during a 6 to 8 hour sleep he has more than more than 30 such breath holding spells so I think the question was what are the symptoms of sleep apnea so one symptom which is almost always present its universal symptom is loud snoring this is a very very important symptom that they complain of and they have very disturbed sleep they awaken during sleep frequent awakenings are very common and suddenly the breath may stop they may have some some choking episodes they may gasp for breath they may have restless moments during sleep and often during daytime because of lack of adequate sleep, lack of oxygenation, they feel lot of fatigue and they feel excessively sleepy during daytime. In fact, I think we all may be aware that some people with extreme form of sleep apnea may even go to sleep when they drive a vehicle. So with all this in background, sleep apnea is not a condition to be ignored okay the days are gone when they say that snoring means a very sound sound sleep it is not so loud snoring and those with sleep apnea definitely need to be taken care of thank you again', \" The question that I've been asked is what are the types of sleep apnea? I am Dr. Shankar Kumar, ENT consultant at Apollo Spectra Hospital MRC Nagar. So sleep apnea as I described in the one of the earlier questions I mentioned it is due to breath holding spells which occur during sleep so sleep apnea is mainly it's of one of the two types. See, it's often we must understand during breathing, the breathing occurs on its own mode. It's automatic response. The centers in the brain, they make us breathe by sending the appropriate signals to the muscles of breathing if there is a fault at the central nervous system so that the muscles which make one breathe are not activated it leads to one form of sleep apnea which is called as central central sleep apnea in other words in central sleep apnea during deep sleep the respiratory effort is lacking second type of sleep apnea is when there is a good effort of breathing but the patient is not able to take an adequate breath. This is due to some form of an obstruction in the upper airway passages. So much so this form of sleep apnea is called as obstructive sleep apnea. Obstructive sleep apnea, generally the sleep apnea may occur due to obstructive sleep apnea may occur due to obstruction at any of the following sites It may be in the nasal passages, it may be in the throat what we call as the pharynx in the region of the palate and sometimes it may be due to bulky base of tongue any of these conditions may cause a condition called as obstructive sleep apnea. And of course, more rarely there may be a mix of the two the central sleep apnea and the obstructive sleep apnea and a mix of the two conditions is called as mixed sleep apnea but generally when we talk about the condition sleep apnea, we refer only to the syndrome of obstructive sleep apnea.

What can I eat if I suffer from tonsillitis? We are often told by members of the family and some of the elderly people Do not take ice cream, do not take ice water do not take ice water it may aggravate the infection in your tonsils but to be honest such a statement has got no scientific basis. It is not proven that taking ice cream or taking ice water can aggravate or lead to tonsillitis it is not so in fact you may be aware of the fact after tonsillectomy surgery the diet we recommend for the children is usually ice cream because this is very soothing to the throat and it generally does not contain does not harm the throat in any way. So in other words ice cream and ice water in my opinion it is something which need not be avoided. So let us come to the fact what should be taken, what should not be taken. What should be taken? Any food which is easy to swallow easy to digest okay non acidic substances okay stay away from coffee alcohol stay away from bitter food and anything which is soft, easy to swallow and easy to digest, it can be taken. Like for example, they can take some mashed rice like a Kanji. It can be taken. Oatmeal can be taken. Any form of juices, fruit juice can be taken. What should be avoided if a patient is suffering from a tonsillitis is something very hot because already the throat is inflamed and by taking anything hot, spicy, excessively spicy may even aggravate the discomfort, discomforting sensation of the throat. Thank you again.', \" Hello again to everybody, I am Dr. Shankar Kumar, ENT Consultant, ENT Surgeon at Apollo Spectra Hospital, Emma Sinagar, Chennai. So the question that I have been asked is that what leads to an infection in the sinuses? Yet again a very interesting question basically it could be something very simple as trivial as even a common cold. Any of the viruses which can make a person prone to common cold, they can also cause an infection in the sinus cavity. So this is one thing. So secondly the infection may be due to bacterial infection as well. Generally in all the infective conditions of the sinuses, the first 7 to 10 days, the symptoms are due to viral condition and we call it as a acute viral sinusitis so in this stage generally we do not give any antibiotics we put the patient on nasal decondition asked him to do steam inhalations like that but after 10 days and it can go on it can last for even up to one whole month. Secondary bacterial infection may occur. This is called as a bacterial infection of the sinuses bacterial sinusitis in this condition in addition to the treatment mentioned earlier like a nasal decondistance, some simple pain medication, antibiotics are definitely required for this condition. Apart from this, occasionally sinus infection may be caused by fungi. We all know what's a fungus. Fungus are found everywhere in the air that we breathe. But it so happens that some people were very allergic to the fungus that we inhale so this leads to a fairly common condition, I should say, it is called allergic fungal sinusitis and this condition allergic fungal sinusitis is a fairly difficult condition to treat and this may require combined surgical and medical treatment. Apart from this we come to one more category of patients who frequently keep developing developing sinusitis it may be a recurrent episode or may be chronic in these patients generally there is some sort of an underlying problem the underlying problem could be a nasal allergy could be some sort of obstruction in the nasal cavity like a deviated nasal septum or it could be growth of some soft tissue in the nasal cavity called nasal polyps. So in those patients who develop recurrent bouts of sinusitis, some sort of a surgical measure may be required to tackle this underlying problem. Thank you.\", \" Hello to everybody, I am Dr. Shankar Kumar, ENT consultant at Apollo Spectra Hospital Hospital MRC Nagar The next question is what is a cochlear implant? What is meant by cochlear? Cochlear is part of the inner ear which sends the sound signals through the auditory nerve into the brain and which makes us here. So what we mean by a cochlear implant is that it's an electrical device which helps a person who has got severe to profound hearing loss. So it is a game changer in these patients having severe to profound hearing loss and generally the implantation or the cochlear implantation is only recommended for a person who has got hearing loss on both sides. It is not intended for one sided hearing loss and it is intended for hearing loss on both sides and also in home we have tried all the other options we have tried hearing aid where the hearing aid trial has failed to give a good good benefit these would be the candidates for undergoing cochlear implantation so basically this has taken a lot of enthusiasm in the recent times especially it is being done more frequently in children because in children the only way to develop the speech and language skills is early development of the hearing apparatus. So it's very important. In fact, in the earlier days, they used to wait to do the cochlear implant till the age of 4 to 5 years or even 6 years but now it is well proven that about 60 to 70% of the language skills the vocabulary is learned by the age of 4 to 5 years nowadays the trend is to be more aggressive and to perform the cochlear implant as soon as we can. In fact, children even as young as 6 months of age are recommended to undergo cochlear implant.

Can a surgeon tell if a growth is a cancer or not by looking at it and by examining it? Absolutely yes, because clinical examination is the first key in the diagnosis of cancer. Whenever a patient comes with any kind of new growth or a tumor or a lump as the case may be. Most cancers can present only like this. They are asymptomatic. They may not have pain. When a surgeon examines it, he is able to find out whether the growth is going to be cancerous by looking at some of the features. Whether it is attached to the surrounding areas, whether it is soft or firm or hard, whether there is going to be other sinister features whether there are skin changes whether there is an alteration so all of these are close to the diagnosis and you know a surgeon can make a diagnosis in almost ninety percent of cases just by looking and touching and feeling the cancer and the rest of the investigations are just going to confirm it. So 90% of the diagnosis is made by clinical examination.

Very rarely it is documented that due to immunotherapy or immunological mechanisms as you can see our own body's immunity can destroy a very few cancers but by and large 99.99% of all cancers require some form of treatment which can be in the form of surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted therapy or immunotherapy in today's world for the cancer to be cured.

Common question, can we remove the cancers? Does the cancer spread after a biopsy or a surgery? This is a common doubt that many of my patients will have after or when we are planning surgery for cancers. Doctor, will the cancer grow after surgery is done or will the cancer grow after biopsy is done. Now the answer to this question is we have something called a zero order kinetics in the sense the growth of the cancer is going to be almost completely prevented if you remove the tumor completely when you are giving let's say for example radiation therapy or chemotherapy for cancer suppose there are hundred cells about 50 cells will get destroyed in the first instance and then 75 and then 92 like that it goes but in cancer surgery we are going to remove 100 percent of the cells which are going to be there because surgery is usually done for the early stage cancers where all the cells are going to be removed which are going to be visible. Suppose there is a tumor in the breast, the breast or the tumor is removed then all the cells are going to be removed so cancer will not grow after surgery or after a biopsy this is a clear-cut thing proven time and again so after surgery the patient's body will adapt to the changes and small tumor cells, which may be there circulating in the blood, which currently we do not have the technology to identify, they will be taken care of by the patient's immunity and further supplemented by chemotherapy and radiation.\", \" Namaste, I am Dr. Balaji, Consultant Surgical Oncologist from the RECNAC Oncology Team at the Apollo Spectra Hosp hospitals with more than 12 years experience in the field of oncology. Which cancer has the highest risk of recurrence? There are many cancers which have so to say bad tumor biology. So when you take up tumor biology, I tell all my patients that what is the chance of cure from cancer? There are multiple factors that determine this. One is going to be the treatment factor so how well we are going to give the treatment for this whether the treatment is given in a planned fashion or not like if surgery is needed first surgery chemo is needed first chemo or you need both then you give both so that is the treatment planning which is completely under the doctor's control then you have the patient factor meaning if a patient requires surgery for treatment but the patient is not fit for surgery, then that is definitely going to affect the treatment of the patient. But again, if the patient is going to be fit enough, then they can withstand all the treatments that are needed. The third and the most important factor is going to be something called as tumor biology. Now this is going to ultimately determine how well a patient is going to be cured from cancer because tumor biology cannot be determined either by the surgeon or by the radiation oncologist or by the medical oncologist we can do our best to treat the cancer that is why even in stage 1, about 5-10% of patients can come back with the recurrence. Now if you take up tumors with a bad tumor biology, some of these include lung cancers, pancreatic cancers, esophageal cancers. Now these are supposed to have a bad tumor biology meaning even in early stage disease even if we do a complete treatment, some of these tumours have got the ability to come back and spread to other areas. Whereas if you take up, let's say colon cancer for example, even in stage 4 disease, stage 4 is the last stage of cancer which is considered to be incurable but even in stage 4 disease colorectal cancer can be cured if the patient has got a liver metastasis if it has gone to the liver then the liver can be removed and chemotherapy can be given and the patient will be cured even in stage 4 whereas in case of pancreatic cancer even if the patient has got let's say a stage 2 cancer the chance of recurrence is going to be very high so tumor biology is the most important factor in the crims and tumors with a bad tumor biology are pancreas, esophagus. These are some of the common ones. And of course, lung cancer also.

If you consider the most common cancers throughout the world, the leading cancer in men is lung cancer and the leading cancer in women is breast cancer. In India, again, breast cancer is the most common cancer in women, but in men it is the oral cavity cancers. So if you take up the cause, oral cavity cancer is mostly due to use of tobacco and other tobacco related products. Whereas in case of breast cancer, it is mainly due to the hormonal and the genetic changes that happen in the body so the top two cancers today in India are the breast cancer in women and the oral cavity cancers in men.', ' Namaste, I am Dr. Balaji, Consultant Surgical Oncologist from the RECNAC Oncology Team at the Apollo Spectra Hospitals. I have more than 12 years of experience in oncology. So the question here is, how soon after surgery does chemotherapy start? Normally speaking, whenever we do a cancer surgery, it depends on how major a surgery it is and which organ we are resecting. For example, if we deal with a breast cancer, then chemotherapy can be started as early as around two weeks after the surgery is getting over. The reason why chemotherapy is given is because even though we remove the tumor, chemotherapy has to be given to tackle the cells which are circulating in the bloodstream. So this best answer will be as soon as possible after surgery. If you ask me for an estimate, roughly speaking, it will be about two weeks to four weeks after surgery which is when the chemotherapy will be started in most cancers once the patient recovers from the surgery thank you Thank you.', ' Namaste, I am Dr. Balaji, consultant surgical oncologist from the RecNAC Oncology team at Apollo Spectra Hospitals with more than 12 years of experience in the field of oncology. This is a common question, how does cancer start? Cancer is something that starts from our own body cells. These cells undergo genetic changes. This genetic change can be caused by multiple agents. It can be smoking, it can be alcohol, it can be lifestyle related changes, it can be due to infections, viruses, bacteria. Any of these may cause the initial genetic change that later transforms our own body cells into the cancer cells. These cells acquire the ability to divide without an end and that is how cancer forms. problems.', ' Namaste, I am Dr. Balaji, Consultant Surgical Oncologist from the ECNAC Oncology Team at the Apollo Spectra Hospitals with more than 12 years experience in oncology. Do healthy people get cancer? Absolutely yes. There is a common misconception that only people who smoke, who drink, who have other lifestyle related, the so-called bad habits, who will develop cancer. But this is not the case. Even healthy people can develop cancer because cancer is ultimately formed from our own body cells due to genetic changes. A common thing that can happen is peptic ulcer disease that is due to a bacterium called H. pylori and this can happen to anybody. So, the so-called healthy people can have this infection without knowing about it and they can develop stomach cancer. In this way, even healthy people can develop cancer. There is nobody who is safe from cancer. Thank you.', \" Namaste, I am Dr. Balaji, Consultant Surgical Oncologist from the RECNAC Oncology team at the Apollo Spectra Hospitals with more than 12 years experience in the field of oncology. Now the question here is, how soon does a patient recover from cancer surgery? This is a kind of a very generalized question. It depends on which part of the body is being operated upon. How does it affect the oral intake? All this is going to be depending on what kind of surgery is being done. If you take up surface surgeries like for example breast cancer, thyroid cancer, soft tissue cancers, all of these once the resection is over, meaning once the surgery is is over on the same day diet can be started for these kinds of patients and so the recovery is going to be much much faster for them by around 10 days to 12 days the sutures will be removed and the patient will be kind of completely back to normal. By the first day, they will be taking their food, they'll be walking around and all that. On the other hand, when we do surgeries in the abdomen, inside the stomach or the small bowel or the large intestine, in such cases, oral feeds start usually after 3 to 5 days. So in such scenarios, the recovery is going to be going on for at least maybe a 7 to 14 days. In general though recovery from cancer surgery takes place in about 2 to 4 weeks after surgery and most patients unless there are complications will be back on track by this time. Thank you.\", \" Namaste, I am Dr. Balaji, Consultant Surgical Oncologist from the RECNAC Oncology Team at the Apollo Spectra Hospitals with more than 12 years experience in the field of oncology. Can cancer go away by itself? Now, this is something that people do believe in. Very rarely it is documented that due to immunotherapy or immunological mechanisms as you can see our own body's immunity can destroy a very few cancers but by and large 99.99% of all cancers require some form of treatment which can be in the form of surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted therapy or immunotherapy in today's world for the cancer to be cured. Thank you.\", ' How a woman can do a self-examination of breast? Hi friends, this is Dr. Sultana, consultant gynecologist from Apollo Spectra. Now, how a woman can do a self examination of breast You need to have few basic steps cleared So that you do a good examination Now this is very cheap and also a convenient procedure so that the women does not have to go to a hospital to get it as I was of examined and if she finds anything abnormal during a self-examination she can get the expert opinion. Now how do we do a self-examination? There are few points that you need to follow. First the woman has to stand in front of a mirror and see herself. And when she observes herself in front of the mirror, she has to look if both the breasts appear normal, is it same as it was before and to look for any discharge or any distortion in the appearance of the breast. Second, she needs to palpate her breast. Now how does she do this palpation? What she has to do is first lift her hands up in front of the mirror and also observe any changes are there. And then she needs to palpate the very top of the mirror and also observe any changes are there and then she needs to palpate the breast right from the center that is where the nipple and areola is there and go in a circular motion such that she covers the whole breast. She can either do it in a circular motion such that she covers the whole breast. She can either do it in a circular motion or she can do from nipple she can go upwards and then downwards and from right to left. In this way she has to do both the breasts separately. Any abnormality that she finds in a way any swelling or any distortion or any fluid discharge from the nipple then it is always better that she gets an expert opinion. Thank you.', \" Hi viewers, on behalf of Spectra Hospitals, I am going to talk about the treatment options of prostate cancer. Once diagnosed with prostate cancer we then divide the patient into as whether they have cancer located within the prostate or they have cancer which is spread through the body. If the cancer is located within the prostate then we have two options overall. One is a surgery to remove the whole prostate and other is to give radiation from outside. Both the options are extremely safe and many a times the surgery is done as a day case especially using a robotic technology. In this process we remove the whole prostate and join the bladder with the urine pipe and leave the patient with the catheter for seven days. The biggest advantage of surgery is that the prostate is gone. The disadvantages of surgery is that there will be urinary incontinence, leakage of urine for at least 6 weeks to 3 months and depending upon how the patients do something called Kegel exercises, they recover from that incontinence very quickly as well. Many patients also notice impotence after the treatment with surgery and they may need help for that as well. In a localized prostate cancer, the majority of the patients who undergo surgery gets cured. On the other hand, radiotherapy On the other hand radiotherapy the advantage of radiotherapy is that you don't need to have an operation. The disadvantages is that it's a long therapy of about 40 days length and they will give x-ray from outside. We have a modern technology called proton therapy available in the radiation section as well. In addition, we also have cyber knife and this has accelerated the treatment as well as made the treatment more precise as well. The disadvantages of radiation include mild incontinence in 3 to 5% of the patient at 3 years and beyond of follow-up.\", \" Hi, I'm Dr. Ashim Desai.

Other area of interest is endoscopic sinus surgery and surgery of rhinoplasty that is the shaping of the external nasal dorsum. You see sinusitis is an inflammation of the tissues that are lining the sinuses for more than a certain number of days in the medical terminology. In reality what happens is that 9 times out of 10 allergy is mistaken for sinusitis and this is the problem that we are facing in our medical practice today. 9 cases out of 10 who come to us with frequent sinus issues are typically allergies because allergies cause inflammation of the nose. Inflammation leads to blockage of the openings of the sinus and that leads to persistent accumulation of liquids, fluids, so on and so forth within the sinus cavity. Now, as far as sinusitis is concerned, sometimes most many patients complain of sinus pains That is sinus headaches That is in the mid face part of the face And in reality that's not really sinusitis at all But it's a migraine it's called a mid facial pain syndrome and the best way to diagnose this is to subject the patient to a CT scan during his headache. And when you see that the signs are clear, it is mostly a migraine kind of headache. So most important point that I would like to draw your attention to is that not all sinus pains are due to sinusitis. Most of the times is due to allergies. Often it is due to mid facial pain syndrome and only rarely is it sinusitis. The cause of sinusitis also is frequently allergy. Frequent allergies causes frequent infection and frequent infection leads to chronic infection and that is called sinusitis. And again, what happens is that inappropriate and excessive overuse misuse and abuse of antibiotics is what causes the sinus problem to become even more chronic and once it leads to a certain level of chronicity what will be required is surgery. Typically the best way to treat sinus problems is to cure the allergies. As long as you diagnose your allergies, you're able to avoid whatever your, whatever food articles or environmental allergies that you are allergic to, or give yourself desensitizing vaccine so that whatever substances you may be allergic to, the allergies fade away over a period of time without the use of medication, without the use of antibiotics, anti-estemlinics and steroids. That is one of the best preventive ways to prevent getting chronic sinusitis. Once sinusitis occurs it has to be treated appropriately by the doctor, by the consultant ENT surgeon, adequate antibiotics, long course of antibiotics and occasionally even steroids may need to be given to control the sinusitis. And in a worst case scenario, if it leads to allergic fungal sinusitis causing polyps, then surgery would be the only remedy.\", \" Hi, I'm Dr. Ashim Desai.

Sleep apnea has many many forms of manifestation and there are a couple of things that you can try out at home also in case you have mild forms of sleep apnea. One of the best things that one can do is sleep on the side. People who sleep on their backs are more prone to sleep apnea. So the most important thing that you can do is turn onto your side. You can decide, your partner can decide whether you snore less on the left side or the right side. But whichever side you snore less, you can certainly sleep on the side. The second most important thing that you can do is go in for a good weight loss regime. Eight times out of ten, sleep apnea occurs in obese people. Snoring occurs in obese people and weight loss is one of the fundamental things that you can do in order to reduce your incidence of sleep apnea. Sometimes weight loss can be even life-saving. As far as other things are concerned, nasal blockage. People with chronic colds, with chronic nasal obstruction, these patients once you treat the chronic colds and chronic nasal obstructions, the amount of sleep apnea drastically reduces. because remember that the incidence the the increase in the intrathoracic pressure that means the pressure that is build up building up within your chest as you inhale sharply during your snoring episodes begins with the nose. And if the nose is blocked, then the chances of sleep apnea increases quite strongly. Another thing that you can do is practice singing. Movement of the mouth, movement of the jaw increases the tension and the tone of the muscles of the jaw and the tongue and that allows slight reduction in sleep apnea. But remember, none of this will make any sense in a moderate or severe sleep apnea. So the best thing for you to do is diagnose yourself for sleep apnea so the best thing for you to do is diagnose yourself for sleep apnea and take the necessary precautions and remedies as far as non home remedies are concerned there are surgeries that can help for sleep apnea. But today, the gold standard is to use a CPAP machine. A CPAP machine is a small mask that is worn on the face connected to an air pressure pump and what it does it gives you a positive flow of air pressure and that pushes the tissues that are collapsing and you are able to breathe well and the sleep apnea incident stops right away. Sometimes a lot of people cannot tolerate these things. And therefore, for them, in certain selected individuals, surgery also can play a major role in alleviating the symptoms of sleep apnea. you\", \" Hi, I'm Dr. Ashim Desai.

Other area of interest is endoscopic sinus surgery and surgery of rhinoplasty that is the shaping of the external nasal dorsum. Sleep apnea is a very very under diagnosed and under recognized condition in our country. Sleep apnea means the slow reduction in the amount of oxygen and the stoppage of air flow at the nose for more than 10 seconds during your sleep. Now sleep apnea generally is associated with snoring and in our country snoring is an accepted part of day-to-day living but little do you know that snoring can be of two types. One is a simple snoring that is a vibration of the tissues of the throat. And the second one is snoring associated with sleep apnea, wherein the amount of oxygen concentration of the blood drops to dangerously low levels and this requires recognition in the form of diagnostic sleep studies. The problem with sleep apnea is that it manifests in many many different ways. First it is excessive daytime sleepiness. One of the fundamental sleep apnea symptoms that we see is excessive daytime sleepiness. There are a lot of people who require to lie down in the afternoon and rest. And this is generally due to sleep apnea or imperfect sleep at night. Another issue, another very very major problem with sleep apnea is the increased incidence of heart disease increased incidence of stroke people with diabetes and hypertension have larger fluctuations of their sugar levels as well as the blood pressure levels because of sleep apnea many many cases of daytime accidents due to this is called daytime hypersomnolence when the driver is driving along the road and suddenly he gets what is known as microburst of sleep. These micro episodes of sleep are the commonest cause of accidents and vehicular accidents in our country. Finally, for the menfolk, the issue of importance also can occur due to chronic sleep apnea. So it is something that needs to be diagnosed. As soon as you find or your partner finds that you're not sleeping well, you don't feel fresh when you wake up in the morning and when you snore excessively at night, you should have yourself assessed for sleep apnea for sure.\", \" Hi, I'm Dr. Ashim Desai.

The most important way of preventing ear infection is to stop using buds, matchsticks, keys to scratch the ears. That is the commonest cause of external canal infections. The second commonest cause is when you are swimming with a lot of wax accumulation and debris in your ear, in which case you'll be prone to fungal infections so those of you who are interested in swimming should use ear plugs as far as possible and especially because splashing water itself can perforate the eardrum. I have had many cases in which the people dive into the pool or people splash the ears during water sports and visiting the water park and end up with a perforation in the ear drum which causes chronic infection and then they will ultimately require surgery. So the best thing that one can do is to avoid sudden contact of water in the ear, have your ear assessed by a physician to make sure there is no major wax accumulation and make sure that you don't use any firm, any implements to keep scratching at the ear canal.\", \" Hi, I'm Dr. Ashim Desai.

Allergies basically in the head neck region manifests as frequent colds, sneezing, watering of the nose and even sometimes may lead to nasal blockage and that is causing the snoring and sleep apnea also. Now allergies typically are not correctly treated in our country. What happens in our country is we keep getting frequent doses of antibiotics, frequent anti-cold medications, which are sedative most of the times and frequent use of nasal drops. And often we turn into frequent nasal drop users turning into nasal drop addicts. Why? Because the allergies cause our nose to block up. So we take a quick fix by using a decongestant spray. And at the end of the decongestants spray, we feel better. And it causes rebound congestion four to six hours down the road. And this causes frequent use of these medications to me me less than 0.5% of our population is correctly diagnosed with allergies and allergy is one of the fundamental causes of poor quality of life throughout the world. According to the World Health Organization, almost 30 crore Indians are suffering from allergies of one form or another and out of them as you know you your friends your family very few have been correctly diagnosed and treated for allergies. This is one of the sad parts of treating allergies in our country. A lack of awareness, a lack of proper diagnostic facilities and a lack of treatment. Many times our doctors tell us that look, allergies live with them. They cannot be treated. But the reality is that allergies, when correctly diagnosed, can be treated well. And you can even get immune therapy. That means reduction of your allergic tendency over a period of time. Immune therapy can also be performed. Many times the doctor says that why do allergy tests? So many different allergies would be found, but the reality is far from true, far from that. Because what happens is that as far as allergies are concerned, there is something known as cross reactive of allergies, cross reaction of allergies. Cross reactivity means that you may be allergic to 10 things but avoiding only one of them will be sufficient to help you over a period of time. So my suggestion to all viewers is that when you are suffering from chronic colds, when your child is suffering from chronic colds, watering, sneezing, nasal block. The best thing you can do for yourself is identify your allergies and get to yourself immune therapy if appropriate in your particular situation. This will help improve the quality of life and improve and reduce the incidence of sinusitis in our country.\", \" Hi, I'm Dr. Ashim Desai.

Hearing loss has a very very wide spectrum of causes and it is very important to exactly define what is causing the hearing loss. There are two types of hearing loss. One is acute sudden hearing loss and the second one is gradually progressive hearing loss. Now, in cases of acute sudden hearing loss it is very important for an urgent diagnosis to be made because in case it is due to a sudden blockage of the nerve of hearing and sudden loss of circulation of the nerve of hearing it requires emergent treatment. Now if it is just due to wax or some external canal blockage and that is causing the hearing loss then the option would be to have the ear cleaned out. But all of this requires an expert opinion. So it is strongly recommended that in cases of acute hearing loss, you immediately consult an ENT surgeon because often acute hearing losses of irreversible types are associated with cold and cough and things like that. So often the family physician may say that look this is due to the cold and usually it is not due to the cold it's due to some sudden block of circulation in the nerve of hearing. As far as slow onset hearing losses are concerned, really there are no home remedies for that. You would need to diagnose the cause because some are curable, some are incurable. Such as, for example, your grandparents may be having an issue that is an age related hearing loss for which they require a properly fitted hearing aid. The problem with hearing aid fitment is that most people possess, most people focus more on their worldly possessions such as a fancy phone or a fancy car.

Most of the times tonsillitis is not really an infection of the tonsils, but it is due to a bad throat caused by reflux acidity and caused by a reduced immunity to the overall incidence of infection. And finally, it can also be due to frequent attacks of allergy. Allergy itself lowers immunity and that causes frequent infection in the throat. Reflux acidity causes the reflux of acidic content at the back of the throat and this causes frequent sore throats, frequent pain in the throat, which are often misdiagnosed as tonsillitis. To me, tonsillitis or so-called tonsillitis represents one of the commonest use, commonest reasons for the overuse and misuse of antibiotics. The best way to treat this kind of a scenario is to have yourself diagnosed in whether there is really an infection or not. A simple test such as CBC and ASO titer that anti-streptolysin O titer and a C-reactive protein test will give you an indication of whether we are dealing with an infection or just dealing with allergies, reduced immunities or frequent gastroesophageal reflux disease, which goes into the throat, which has an independent terminology called laryngeal pharyngeal reflux. Now any of these can mimic tonsillitis. So the best thing for you to do is to diagnose which condition you have rather than continuously taking antibiotics, anti-histaminic and steroids to take care of this condition and sometimes if it's due to allergy, a good allergy testing will help you. You should use allergy testing to diagnose what your allergies may be to get yourself immunized against those that you have those substances that you are allergic to as well as take generalized immune stimulants in the form of medicines such as Pidotimod and any homegrown immune stimulant also can help. you\", \" I am Dr Lalit Mohan Parashar.

When we see someone snoring, we don't simply ignore it because we know at the base of it can be a very dangerous disease called obstructive sleep apnea. So our aim is not simply stopping the snoring. Our aim is to treating the person and taking away the underlying illness so by that reckoning there can be broadly speaking three ways of dealing with the stoppage of snoring one the, the home made remedies whereby we tell the patient to reduce weight, change the lifestyle modifications, be more active, energetic, exercise so that muscles of the body are toned up. They can also result to some exercise of the throat and palate like chewing gum, like pranayam, breathing exercises so that they have more control and all the things don't go lags when they sleep. Second part is other modifications like sleeping posture. They can sleep on a side rather than straight. They can sleep prone actually. They can have on the side rather than straight. They can sleep prone actually. They can have better pillows where their neck is taken up rather than down. Also, we can tell the patients to assume postures where they are able to sleep in a much better position with less lighting of the room and some pipe music, some soft music playing. These are homemade remedies. Almost everyone does try these out before we take up the patient for other interventions. The other intervention can be medical management whereby we tell the patient to wear some appliances called CPAP or BiPAP or AutoPAPs. These machines work on the principle of forcing open the obstructed airway. That is when the person is trying to breathe and there is obstruction of the airway. We force open the airway. So these machines patient has to wear regularly, daily, every night. But please use these machines under medical supervision because we might be missing in our eagerness to use such appliances to take away only the sound part of snoring we might miss the underlying disease so whenever you have the such machines are to use such machines it should be under proper medical supervision only doctor should be able to tell you and of course in more severe patients the doctor may advise your surgeon may advise you to go for advanced surgeries of the nose palate throat or tonsils so that we open up the passages.\", ' I am Dr Lalit Mohan Parashar.

When we diagnose a patient of sleep apnea, obstructive sleep apnea, we have to right in the beginning decide how troublesome this thing is for the patient. Some of the sleep apnea patients may have a very very drastic symptomatology that is their oxygen levels are falling so much that they can actually die during their sleep. Having identified such patients who require such intervention intervention we need to open up their passages so our guide to opening of passages is their dynamic MRI and the x-rays we take with the x-ray we are able to pinpoint where exactly is the obstruction in the tonsil, in the pharynx, at the palate level, in the nose or in the turbinates. Wherever the obstruction, we try to open it up. For opening it up for opening it up our simple goal is that we can take the patient up for surgery wherever possible open up all the passages once the whole thing is open we should patient at the end of the day should be able to breathe very easily in the normal circumstances and during sleep, patient should be able to breathe very easily and therefore not have snoring as well as not have the symptoms associated with the obstruction. These surgeries involved correcting the nasal septum, shrinking the turbinates that is changing the shape of the turbinate to a smaller position so that the whole passage opens up more we can give cuts on the palate we can sacrifice the you will and part of the palate which is called you low pallet oplasty we can also modify the surrounding walls of the throat which are called pharynx so this is called pharyngoplasty we can also shrink the base of the tongue. At the back of the tongue, we can take away some tissue, burn up some tissues, so that resultant scar tissue takes the whole thing away from the center, so that the whole passage opens up. These surgeries are known as surgeries for obstructive sleep apnea. These require very specialized instruments, cannot be done at a very small setup so we necessarily have this equipment and the wear vital and the technology to deal with such surgeries at our apollo spectra in kalash colony', \" I am Dr Lalit Mohan Parashar.

Sore throat, cold cough is such a common thing that we on average internationally have 2.5 episodes per person per year. So we almost everyone in the family undergoes this illness. Out of these a fair proportion of infections are related to the throat which we call tonsillitis or pharyngitis. Specifically, tonsils is the seat of getting getting catching infections in the throat whatever is passing in. Our fomite based infection where we touch the things which other people have touched before us and we carry the infection in our hands and through the mouth and throat and therefore we get infected. So in the crowded places, when we touch the door knobs, when we meet people who are sick and ill and we catch the infection. Now once the infection reaches the tonsils, the symptoms are patient has pain on swallowing, patient has pain on speaking, patient has pain in the throat as such. Besides this, there may be fever, there might be difficulty in even drinking water and in extreme cases, patient can have even loss of consciousness. Now, such patients who are not able to swallow for days on end, 2-3 days and patient keeps on getting home remedies, patient may actually go into dehydration. So we tell the patient to intervene early, take liquids, hot liquids specially tea, coffee and soups are good for them. We also tell them or advise them to take care of their hydration levels. Once they are able to hydrate themselves properly, the patient doesn't go into complications arising after tonsillitis which is dehydration, pneumonia, infection reaching the sinuses, infection reaching the bloodstream and causing extreme fevers. These are basically the treatment for tonsillitis and of course we have to use painkillers and antibiotics if the doctor thinks in that first two days infection is not settling down we have to upgrade the treatment policy to better medications, better antibiotics and maybe sometimes even injectable antibiotics and IV fluids.\", ' I am Dr Lalit Mohan Parashar.

When the person comes to us with the hearing loss, generally we have a fair idea what is the reason for the hearing loss generally we have a fair idea what is the reason for the hearing loss the hearing loss reasons can be disease of the external ear that is wax etc which we can remove very easily under Under vision, we syringe or suction out the wax or contents of the external artery canal, ear canal we call it. There can be disease of the ear drum or middle ear. We can assess the whole thing by various means by hearing test and know that the ear drum is missing or vacant, there is perforation. We can do the surgeries for such ear drums and inner ear, middle ear illnesses. That is by taking the patient to the operation theatre, reconstructing the ear drum by cartilage or fascia, we can make the ear drum whole and inside there are three bones which are conducting the sounds, these are called ossicles. We can repair these bones so that we have a conducting assembly. Sound from outside which reaches the ear drum can get conducted to the middle ear, to inner ear and from there the nerve can take you to the brain. There is another subset of people in which the inner ear is not working properly or the nerve is not working properly. These are the patients where we have to think in terms of cochlear implant surgery. That is we implant like other implants in the body, the implants for the lens or knee replacements, we can put such implant which is called cochlear implant. We implant under the, we put the implant under the skin of the scalp, take the wire into the inner ear and leave it next to the nerve over there so that when the person hears, the cochlear implant can convert these sounds into currents and these currents can be taken by the nerve inside to the brain. The brain will get the proper sound as a normal person. This is called cochlear implant surgery. When the nerve is weak or not functioning inside, as in elderly, as in some people who are hearing, hard of hearing, we have to speak louder for them to hear, make them hear. In those cases we can use the hearing aids. The hearing aids are devices which will simply amplify the sound which the person is getting to a loud sound. That loud sound can be, of course, then perceived by the brain. So this is basically, hearing aid is basically amplifier.', \" I am Dr Lalit Mohan Parashar. I am an ENT specialist.

When we diagnose a patient of obstructive sleep apnea the first question patient wants is that I want something which can be done at home. So practical things which can be done at home are the patient doesn't have to lie supine. Patient lies supine and that is the most problematic as well as sleep apnea or snoring is concerned. So, patient should be lying on his side. We even tell the wives that they can stitch some ball at the back of the pyjama so that they can stitch some ball at the back of pyjama so that patient is not able to lie straight patient has to perforce lie on one side or the other or even prone the other thing is some certain kind of pillow. Normally we put a pillow behind our neck gets flexed like this. In this case we want a pillow which has a curvature like this so that we put on the nape of the neck and neck goes more like this this will open up the air passage so this is a second remedy a third remedy is the patient should have a quiet room without disturbances it should be dimly lit but not totally dark and patient should have had meals at least two to three hours before sleeping so that his stomach is relatively empty and is not too tight about sleeping. Besides this, a small music can be very helpful if the patient can go for it. These are the measures in which the patient can improve the quality of sleep.\", \" I am Dr Lalit Mohan Parashar.

When we diagnose obstructive sleep apnea, we tell the patient to try out the CPAP machines rather during the sleep study itself we think about titration. The main principle of this is that we are dealing with a situation where there is obstruction to the sleep, obstruction to the airway during sleep. We have a machine tied to the patient's face which pushes open the airway that is it has air under certain pressure it puts the pressure and therefore the airway opens up so the patient who was not able to breathe before this machine is able to breathe better. So patient wears this machine which is battery operated or electrically operated. This pushes the air at a certain pressure which is determined during the patient's titration of sleep study. Patient has to continuously wear it every night. But it is seen that once the patient is wearing it, patient's symptoms of a practice sleep apnea disappear, patient seems to be more awake in the day, patient is better able to do his cognitive functions, patient is not required to go to the urine more often and patient doesn't find the throat very dry when the patient wakes up. So it takes away all the symptoms. But only problem with the machine sometimes is most of the patients are not comfortable wearing a machine for the whole night. And therefore, even when they purchase the machine, they are not able to use it very continuously. Rather, in our studies, we have found that more than 75 percent patients purchase a machine but leave it somewhere they don't wear it regularly only 25 percent of patients are comfortable wearing machine daily at night\", \" I am Dr Lalit Mohan Parashar.

So we see whenever our patient gives us a history of snoring with the triad of night time sleepiness night time urination as well as dry throat we think of sleep apnea to diagnose this we do sleep study patients night time recordings of the sleep are taken in which we measure carbon dioxide accumulation, oxygen saturation, we also measure patient's posture in sleeping and heart rate. With all this recording of the whole night we can see whether patient is having a good and sound sleep or not. This recording of the whole night sleep and its interpretation is called Sleep Study. A good doctor is able to tell the patient whether the patient's night time sleep was sound as it should be be which is relaxing and rejuvenating or it was disturbed sleep which the patients of obstructive sleep apnea generally have. Once we have sleep study we can know how bothersome or troublesome this sleep is. If it is very bad, that is, it is life threatening to the patient, then we think in terms of urgent intervention. The other thing we can check up is the airway. From the nose to the back of the nose, to the palate, to tonsil area and pharynx and even base tongue, we can know the whole air passage by doing a dynamic sleep study or simple x-rays of the front and side pores so that we can see the whole airway, threadbare and if there are areas where it is getting clogged or obstructed we can think about surgical options after that\", \" I am Dr Lalit Mohan Parashar.

When the parent complains that my child is not hearing properly, occasionally they use the word like deafness. We of course in medical parlance don't promote the use of word deafness we call it hearing loss. It is basically loss to the patient. So, when the parent complains that patient is not hearing properly, we have to assess the child properly because hearing is very important for the speech development also. Having assessed that we can know the degrees of hearing loss, the causes of hearing loss and then we think in terms of how to rehabilitate such a child or such a person Some adults also lose their hearing either by accident or by meningitis or sequelae of any other major complications of illnesses so once a patient of hearing loss is with us we can help the patient now fortunately we have the devices the best of things is called cochlear implant we can implant a device under the skin of the scalp and take a wire into the inner ear which will replace the inner ear and now the cochlear implant will be doing the work which the ear normally does that is converting the sound into electrical energy which is carried by the nerves from the ear to the brain. So we put in an implant, implant hears that is takes the sound energy from the environment whatever is spoken and that is converted to current that current is delivered directly to the nerve inside and that nerve takes the current as if person is hearing normally to the brain and therefore brain is able to interpret that sound as speech or environmental sounds. This is how we rehabilitate a person who is normally not hearing.\", ' I am Dr Lalit Mohan Parashar. I am an ENT specialist. Now practicing for about 30 years.

When we think of sleep apnea in a particular patient we diagnose if there are ways. After having diagnosed obstructive sleep apnea, we go on to treating. The first treatment option we tell the patient is lifestyle modifications. Patient if he is obese, he has to lose weight. Besides that there are exercises to tone up the muscles of the throat and oral cavity. So we tell them to use chewing gum, speech exercises, pranayama, breathing exercises, go out and run so that they have more control over their breath. Besides these, the patient has to decrease in the total amount of food is taking, food intake has to be decreased. Having done all this, if the patient still does not show the requisite response, then we think in terms of giving them some appliances to wear when they sleep. Appliances can be CPAP or AutoPAP machines which force open the airway when the person sleeps. These machines are cumbersome to wear, difficult to wear but can be an option. More importantly, we assess the airway and if there is obstruction like because of tonsils, because of nose, because of turbinates, because of thick palate, because of heavy uvula or some configurational problem there, we can go and do the surgery and correct the whole thing we have advanced equipment as well as advanced training for these things internationally accepted norms and we open up the passages so that person is able to breathe Open up the passages so that person is able to breathe.', \" I am Dr Lalit Mohan Panasar. I am an ENT specialist. Now practicing for about 30 years. I am in Apollo Spectra in Kalash Colony and we are doing all sort of advanced surgeries as far as ENT is concerned. There are very interesting patients who come to us and say that I hear sounds in the ear. We call it tinnitus. That is patient has perception of sound when actually there is no sound. This is also known by people as ringing of ear or ear is sounding after the blast of our ear. We all have experienced. If there is a bomb blast of our ear, we all have experienced, if there is a bomb blast near us, our ear keeps on ringing for some time. So this is presence of sound in the brain is perceiving sound when there is actually no sound present. This is called tinnitus. Now tinnitus can actually be a very difficult thing to treat but first of all we have to know the cause. We can do the hearing test to know whether inner ear is working alright. There is no irritability of the inner ear. We can also know what is the type of sound that is we can do the tinnitus matching as well as the loudness of sound if the sound is very small I think person can ignore it very easily we all have occasional sounds coming to us which we on closer inspection we don't have any sound and we simply ignore it. If the tinnitus is of a certain level where it is causing disturbance in the patient's life that is patient is not able to sleep properly, patient is not able to sleep properly, patient is not able to work properly, patient is not able to concentrate properly. In those cases, we need certain medicines or appliances to take care of this tinnitus. Now for this tinnitus, first of all the patient needs reassurance that this tinnitus is not harbinger of certain bad illness which the patient is having. The worst fear patient has is that there is some brain tumor inside and they are right. Actually we do the MRI study to rule out any brain tumor because that can sometimes be the first sign of brain tumor that patient has tinnitus. But once having ruled that out, we can also tell the patient to take certain medicines to numb or suppress the nerves. Those medicines decrease the perception of sound and patient is able to live the life normally if the medicine succeeds. Sometimes these medicines cross the blood brain barrier and also cause sleepiness in the patient. So the patient is not able to use such medicines very regularly. In those cases we can even think in terms of certain hearing aid devices which are noise cancellation devices like all the good music system companies come out with the noise cancellation devices. Similarly, we can have tinnitus cancelling hearing aids which the patient wears like hearing aids. But idea is not to raise the sound but to cancel the sound the patient is already hearing in this ear. This is called tinnitus cancelling hearing aids.\", ' I am Dr Lalit Mohan Parashar.

So these surgical interventions can be starting from the nose to open up the nasal passage by making the septum straight we call septoplasty and making the turbinates away from the midline that is opening up the passage. These surgeries are called septoplasty and turbinoplasty are best done under general anesthesia. Then we can also open up the passages by taking away some tissues from the palate, shrinking the palate, cutting open the palate, cutting out the part of the palate and the uvula which is called palatoplasty and uvuloplasty we can also re-modify the walls of the throat which are called pharynx and this is called pharyngoplasty we can also take away part of the base of the tongue so that the whole thing opens up more. These are the set of surgeries which we recommend to the patients of apoptosis lip apnea when the patient has more than a certain level of problem.', ' Hello, this is Dr. Kamal Devgn, MSc, ENT. Currently, I am working at Apollo Hospital as consultant in the department of ENT and Head and Neck Surgery. Today we will discuss about OSA. OSA is Obstructed Sleep Apnea. It is a type of sleep apnea in which there is partial or complete succession of breathing during night. There are occurs repetitive episodes of succession of breathing which can last for 20 to 40 seconds. It can occur multiple times during night. It leads to decrease in blood saturation, which further leads to repetitive episodes, leads to decrease oxygen supply to the brain triggering a response in the brain that is called neurological awakening This neurological awakening leads to a succession of sleeping during night which further leads to restlessness in the body patient wakes up with morning headaches, tiredness, forgetfulness, changes in the mood, behaviour. This obstruction can be complete or temporary. Temporary obstruction or sleep apnea can occur because of the intoxicating drugs like alcohol, some medications. Complete succession can be because of soft tissue pathology excessive muscle relaxation due to some brain injury or deviated nasal septum increase increased hypertrophy of the turbinates acting as an obstruction to the nasal airway. Thank you.', ' This is Dr. Kamal Dagan, MS ENT. Currently I am working at Apollo Hospital as consultant in the department of ENT and head and neck surgery. Today we will discuss about OSA and its symptoms. OSA is obstructive sleep apnea. There occurs repetitive succession of breathing during night. It lasts for 20 to 40 seconds. There can be multiple episodes leading to decreased oxygen saturation of the brain which leads to neurological awakening. Produces symptoms like daytime sleepiness, tiredness, excessive sweating during night, increased changes in mood behavior like irritability, anxiety, weight gain. In children with severe obstructive sleep apnoea, they become hyperactive. Coming to treatment part, treatment starts with lifestyle changes, it includes reducing weight, quit smoking, working regularly Then comes positive airway pressure therapies It includes use of BiPAP machine, CPAP, continuous positive airway pressure. Then comes the surgical part. Surgical part includes surgically removing the tissues that lead to obstruction like reducing the soft tissue that is the UPPP Ullo-Palletofaringoplasty, jaw opening surgeries like maxillomandibular advancement using certain implants. Reducing the obstruction in the nasal cavity like septoplasty, turpinate reduction, adenoidectomy, tonsillectomies. Thank you.', ' Hello, this is Dr. Kamal Devgn, MS ENT. Currently, I am working at Apollo Hospital as a consultant in the department of ENT and head and neck surgery. Today we will discuss about FESS, whether it is safe or not. FESS is functional endoscopic sinus surgery. Yes, it is quite safe in the hand of an expert ENT surgeon. What we do in FAS is we use magnified endoscopes to directly visualize the pathology of the sinuses. Initially, FESS was not known by most of the ENT surgeons but due to so many centers been working upon FESS and so many training hospitals FESS has become more easy. It has become the bread and butter of the anti-surgeons now. What we do in FAS is we operate upon the sinuses like maxillary sinuses, sphenoid sinuses, ethmoid sinuses, frontal sinuses in direct visualization. Initially when we used to operate upon these sinuses, we used a light and we used to externally open these sinuses and then we used to operate. While doing that, it used to lead to bleeding and recurrent infection. Sometimes the closure is not proper. Some pathology has been left. But with the help of the endoscope we can directly visualize any part of the sinuses which initially we were afraid of visualization or operating upon. Now this kind of sinus surgery is become very easy. We can directly visualize, we can see the pathology like polyps, some polyps which initially used to remain. So we can remove it. Now we can operate upon the pituitary gland also through the sphenoid sinus with the help of endoscope. So it has become a very easy surgery but the question is when should we do it. Not all cases are requiring FAST. Generally, those cases where the pathology is what we see and what we have to operate like polyps, recurrent polypsps chronic rhinosinusitis some cancers some inflammatory pathology like inverted papilloma thank you', \" I am Dr. S. Kepal. I am a senior consultant urologist at Apollo Spectra Hospital, Kalash Colony. I have 32 years experience after my MCH degree. Prostate is a sexual organ inside the male's body. This is the only organ in the body which continues to grow throughout our lives and the size continues to enlarge. If it enlarges outside, it does not cause many symptoms or no symptoms at all. But if it enlarges inside the urinary system, then the urinary flow gets reduced. Person has to get up in the night again and again and so many symptoms they start. So we can assume that any person above the age of 40-45 may start developing some symptoms related to prostatic enlargement. Now when there is a prosthetic enlargement in the initial phase, we do only three investigations. One is ultrasound, second is urophilometry and third is serum PSA. Identify and just keep that as a basic parameter because in the due course of time the prostate is going to enlarge further. To reduce the problems created by prostatic enlargement, such people they should remember only three home remedies. Number one, they should not over-distend their urinary bladder. Whenever there is an urge to pass urine, they should immediately go. Even if they are during travel travel they should stop the vehicle find a place and pass urine because if the bladder gets over distended then there are chances that they will not be able to pass urine and they will go into retention of urine second thing is they should not take many cuff syrups or any anti histamine medicines because these medicines will cause reduction in the size of the urinary passage and these people can develop retention of urine, inability to pass urine. Thirdly, they should not get exposed to cold weather because once we get exposed to cold weather there is internal congestion, the blood flow goes inside the internal organs and the urinary passage also becomes narrow and they will go into retention of urine. As such, nobody can prevent prostetic enlargement. It is a disease, rather not a disease, it is just the physiological aging process. Like you cannot stop greying of your hair you cannot stop prosthetic enlargement so only thing is you should you should take precautions so that you don't go into acute retention of urine start medical treatment as early as Don't go into acute retention of urine. Start medical treatment as early as possible. And then do every year follow-up and be with it. You cannot stop enlarging prostate\"]\n"
